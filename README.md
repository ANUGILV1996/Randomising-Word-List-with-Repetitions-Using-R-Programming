# Randomising-Word-List-with-Repetitions-Using-R-Programming

This R script creates a randomised word list with repetitions for experiments. It defines a set of 20 target words, repeats each 10 times, and shuffles them to minimise order effects. The shuffled list is saved as a .csv file with “Tokens” as the column name in the specified directory. The set.seed(123) ensures reproducibility.
